I declare the following statements to be true, effective from the release of 
the aforementioned assessment until its due date and time: 

* The work I submit here is entirely my own. 
* I will not use/have not used any unauthorized aids to complete this assessment. 
Unauthorized aids include but are not limited to
     - the Internet
     - someone else's solutions or partial solutions
NOTE:  if you are unsure if something is unauthorized, check with course staff 
before using it. 
* Because this is an assignment, I may discuss it with others but will not write, 
type, take pictures, or by any other means capture what occurred during the meeting 
and will/did wait at least 30 minutes before recording anything from that meeting. 
* I have not and will not share in whole or in part email/files/documents related 
to the solutions of the assessment except possibly with course staff. 
* I am aware that misconduct related to assessments can result in significant 
penalties, including, zero on the assessment, overall grade deduction and, depending 
on the significance of the assessment, failing the course and suspension (this is 
covered in Policy 71:
